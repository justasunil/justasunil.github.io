		<h1 class="heading">About me</h1>
		<p class="sub_text" style="text-align: justify; white-space: normal;">
			I am a Ph.D. scholar, working with <a href="https://hipec.github.io/" target="_blank">HiPeC Lab</a> at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (<a href="https://iiitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIIT-Delhi</a>), guided by <a href="https://vivkumar.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Vivek Kumar</a> (Assistant Professor at <a href="https://iiitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIIT-Delhi</a>). I also worked at HiPeC Lab as a Research Assistant where I was looking for designing and implementing an energy-efficient runtime for distributed systems using Hybrid programming models.
		</p>
		<p class="sub_text" style="text-align: justify; white-space: normal;">
			Before that, I was a B.Tech student in the computer science and engineering department at IIIT-Delhi. I worked on a research project in HiPeC Lab as an undergraduate researcher. My role in project was to design an energy-efficient runtime library for parallel programs on multi-core processors.


		</p>
		<p class="sub_text" style="text-align: justify; white-space: normal;">
			My Research Interest lies in High Performance Computing and building runtime softwares for HPC systems composed with multicore processors. Particularly, I am interested to design an adaptive runtime software that dynamically adapts power-efficient environments on HPC systems without hurting performance.
